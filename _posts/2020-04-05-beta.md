## At a Glance
* 4 Hours working on adding projectile data to EnemyBalance script
  * Had to deal with merge conflicts with Qrabz prefab
    * I tried to fix it ahead of time by merging development into my branch as I was working
    * Ended up having to redo work on each object
* 4 Hours updating editor UI, making an orderly table and adding buttons to take you to each enemy, adding scroll for when list gets too long
* 2 Hours in Meeting 3/29

* 8 hours Working on making heatmap to visualize where enemies are located in the level, difficulty
* 2 hours tweaking values, dropper had a projectile speed of 500 (very fast) which made it 500 times as difficult as other enemies
* 2 Hours in meeting 4/5
