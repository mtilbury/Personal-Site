title: Alpha to Pre-Beta Sprint
snippet: These past few weeks were stressful, but I was able to get contributions in for the enemy death component and enemy balance editor script.

## At a Glance
The first week in this sprint was spring break, and instead of getting new tasks we worked on finishing up things from the previous sprint. During this time, I worked on the EnemyDeath component which handles behavior when the player kills an enemy. My next task was an editor script to help level designers determine the relative "difficulty" of a level based on the number of certain enemies. This took longer than expected due to the campus shutdown and sudden move-out.
* Wrote enemy death script
  * Runs when any enemy dies. Despawns it, shows a corpse, and plays a particle effect
* Created enemy balance editor script
  * Uses a formula adapted from Alex Kisil's research during DreamWillow
  * Finds all enemies in the scene and calculates their difficulty score
    * Difficulty is defined by attributes like hitbox size, firing rate, etc.
  * Shows this information in an editor window to help level designers
