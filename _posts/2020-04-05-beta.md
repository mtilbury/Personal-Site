snippet: This sprint I got to work on iterating on the editor script from last week.
---
## At a Glance
* 4 Hours working on adding projectile data to EnemyBalance script
  * Had to deal with merge conflicts on Qrabz prefab
    * I tried to fix it ahead of time by merging development into my branch as I was working
    * Ended up having to redo work on each object
* 4 Hours updating editor UI, making an orderly table and adding buttons to select each enemy, adding scroll for when list gets too long
  * Time spent reading Unity docs, figuring out how the UI properties work
* 2 Hours in Meeting 3/29
  * Includes playtesting time

* 8 hours working on making map to visualize the spread of enemy difficulty throughout the level
  * Challenges:
    * Figure out how to make custom scene view or show map in editor window
      * Looked into gizmos, game camera rendering to editor window, settled on OnSceneGUI in the scene view from EditorWindow
    * Rescale on zoom
      * Formula for setting max size, scale responsively
      * Performance issues
    * Scale and color based on difficulty value
* 1 hour tweaking values, dropper had a projectile speed of 500 (very fast) which made it 500 times as difficult as other enemies
* 1 hour implementing new projectile enemy prefab
* 2 Hours in meeting 4/5
* 1 Hour playtesting, write-up
